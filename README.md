A **useful** `UIView` category containing a set of most commonly used animations like rotation, flip, shake and others.

It is designed to be **as easy to use and integrate as possible** with a goal to speed up everyday development tasks. All the methods are well documented and described. 

Furthermore, the category comes along with **a small demo project** where you can see the animations in action.

## Supported animations 

 - Rotation
 - Flip
 - Horizontal and Vertical Shake
 - Pulse
 - Motion Effects (run on the device to see it in action)

## Thread Safety

UIView Animation Extensions is a category on UIView and - as with all UIKit components - it should only be accessed from the main thread.
