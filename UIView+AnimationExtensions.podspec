                   ##UIView Animation Extensions 

A **useful** `UIView` category containing a set of most commonly used animations like rotation, flip, shake and others.

It is designed to be **as easy to use and integrate as possible** with a goal to speed up everyday development tasks. All the methods are well documented and described. 

Furthermore, the category comes along with **a small demo project** where you can see the animations in action.

# Animations 
Extension contains helper methods for the following animations:
## Rotation
```objective-c
[boxView rotateToAngle:M_PI * 2.0f
              duration:1.0f
             direction:UIViewAnimationRotationDirectionLeft
           repeatCount:HUGE_VALF
           autoreverse:YES];
```

## Flip
```objective-c
[boxView flipWithDuration:0.3f
                direction:UIViewAnimationFlipDirectionFromLeft
              repeatCount:2
              autoreverse:NO];
```

              repeat:YES];
```

## Motion Effects
```objective-c
[boxView applyMotionEffects];
```
Can't be shown in a gif. Run on the device to see it in action.

# Thread Safety

UIView Animation Extensions is a category on `UIView` and - as with all `UIKit` components - it should only be accessed from the main thread.
